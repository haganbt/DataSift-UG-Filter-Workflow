DataSift-UG-Filter-Workflow
===========================

Example web application demonstrating user generated filter validation using the DataSift Historics Preview API.

Live Demo: <a href="http://dsfilter.herokuapp.com/">http://dsfilter.herokuapp.com/</a>

The web application shows how the historics preview API can be used in conjunction with the Query Builder to allow users to create their own filter definitions, and have volumes estimated.

This can be useful for enforcing corporate data limits, or catching badly formed filters e.g. stop words.
